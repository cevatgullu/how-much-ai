# How Much AI

How Much AI is a self-hosted dashboard for subscription usage limits across multiple AI accounts. It currently tracks Claude (Anthropic) and ChatGPT/Codex (OpenAI), refreshes readings automatically, and can send reset or high-usage alerts.

This repository is the open-source, single-tenant edition. It has no hosted sign-in, billing, marketing site, analytics, or provider lock. You run it, choose where its encrypted vault is stored, and control every secret it uses.

> How Much AI is unofficial and is not affiliated with Anthropic or OpenAI.

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22.18.0 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeraphKc/how-much-ai.git
cd how-much-ai
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Before starting, set `APP_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` to an independent strong value. Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The development command binds explicitly to `127.0.0.1` and stores accounts in an encrypted local vault under `.data/`.

Development and production both fail closed when `APP_PASSWORD` is missing. Ordinary development and self-hosting never enter an unauthenticated open mode.

## Connect accounts

Click **Connect account**, then choose a provider:

- **Claude** — use the private app sign-in flow and paste the returned `code#state`. A same-machine Claude Code login and Convex-backed device pairing are also available as convenience options. `claude setup-token` is inference-only and cannot read the subscription-usage endpoint.
- **ChatGPT/Codex** — read the Codex login from the machine running the app or paste the contents of `~/.codex/auth.json`.

Credentials are encrypted in the server-side vault and are never returned to the browser after connection. Local and device-pairing shortcuts may share a rotating CLI credential; the provider-specific private sign-in is the more durable choice when available.

Same-machine CLI discovery is automatic in development. In a production-mode local install it requires `ENABLE_LOCAL_CONNECT=1`; never enable that route on a remote server.

## Secure Windows local mode

For the reviewed, authenticated, loopback-only Windows installation and its exact threat boundary, see [Secure Windows local mode](docs/WINDOWS_SECURE_LOCAL.md). The installer adds a verified **How Much AI** Start-menu launcher whose hash-bound arguments contain only the state root and public hashes, never a URL, secret, ticket, account, provider, or credential. It validates both exact scheduled tasks before reopening the dashboard: a `Ready` service starts Service then Window, while a `Running` service starts Window only; any mismatch or other state refuses to start either task. The browser session is established with challenge/server-proof/client-proof HMAC using the protected `AUTH_SECRET`; it never transmits `APP_PASSWORD`. Complete the pre-credential security gate before connecting any real provider account.

## Choose a storage mode

The server selects one backend from the environment:

| Backend | Configuration | Best for | Notifications |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encrypted file | No variables | One persistent machine | No |
| Convex | `CONVEX_URL` + `VAULT_ACCESS_SECRET` | Durable or multi-instance hosting | Yes |
| Redis/KV REST | URL + token + `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Durable hosting without Convex | No |

Local file storage creates `.data/vault.enc` and `.data/vault.key`. Back up the whole `.data` directory; the encrypted vault cannot be recovered without its matching key or configured encryption secret.

See [Self-hosting](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) for complete Convex, Redis, notification, backup, reverse-proxy, and production instructions. Every supported variable is documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Put it on a network safely

Copy the example environment file and replace the blank values you need:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

At minimum, a networked deployment should set independent strong values for:

```dotenv
APP_PASSWORD=
AUTH_SECRET=
VAULT_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=
```

Then verify and build:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm start
```

Terminate TLS at a trusted reverse proxy or hosting platform. Keep `TRUST_PROXY_IP_HEADERS=0` unless that proxy overwrites the forwarded client-IP headers itself. Serverless platforms must use Convex or Redis because their local filesystems are not durable.

## Notifications

Notifications require Convex because their configuration, detector state, subscriptions, lease, and five-minute scheduler are stored there. Available delivery channels are:

- browser Web Push;
- Telegram;
- a generic JSON webhook.

Redis-only and file-only installs still provide the complete dashboard, provider tracking, encrypted credentials, refresh coordination, and local countdowns; the notification panel will explain that Convex is required for alerts.

## Development

Run all checks from the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The build also checks that local vault material was not copied into the production output. Contributor and AI-agent rules are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). CI runs the same commands on every push and pull request.

## Security and license

Do not commit `.env*`, `.data/`, provider credentials, database tokens, or generated vault backups. If you find a vulnerability, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and do not publish credential material in an issue.
